I recently re-launched Stockstack/ Terminal as Stockstack.AI, available here: [stockstack.ai](https://stockstack.ai). I might change domain again since nothing seems to beat .com, so sorry in advance!

Stockstack.AI is a slimmed down version of Terminal with focus on distraction-free stock market data. The goal is to beat Yahoo Finance in data coverage and user experiance. To reduce workload and to hone in on the goal, I removed several features, including portfolio tracker, batch requests, and query.

The updated version instead shipped with an improved grid for widgets. Widgets now have scalable text, support multiple columns (great for financials), and are freely moveable and resizeable around the workspace. I also updated most widgets data and added several new data sources. If you add your own API key for Seeking Alpha (requires an active subscription), you can basically have five different news widgets, which should be more than enough to give a fairly comprehensive overview of the market.

Other interesting data/ widgets show interest rates by various institutions, market status, upcoming holidays, and company filings (both today and historical for ticker). The old chart widget is replace by four widgets with charts for different ranges, so can view all at same time.
