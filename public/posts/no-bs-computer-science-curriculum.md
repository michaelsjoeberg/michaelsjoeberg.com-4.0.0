## <a name="1" class="anchor"></a> [1. Introduction](#1)

This is an evolving list with learning material and recommended programming languages for computer science students. It works well on its own (for self-learners) or in addition to an undergraduate degree in computer science (or related field). The goal is to provide a solid foundation to build upon, degree or no degree. It will be updated to fix broken links and to keep learning material up to date. If you are interested in computer science and engineering (and have plenty of time to spare), see [github.com/michaelsjoeberg/the-ultimate-computer-science-and-engineering-curriculum](https://github.com/michaelsjoeberg/the-ultimate-computer-science-and-engineering-curriculum).

## <a name="2" class="anchor"></a> [2. Programming](#2)

Programming is the most important skill in computer science and computational problem solving and should be the primary focus of any computer science curriculum (with use cases in computer systems, application software development, theorem proving, and so on). If you prefer to work on projects while learning, see [github.com/tuvtran/project-based-learning](https://github.com/tuvtran/project-based-learning).

### <a name="2.1" class="anchor"></a> [2.1 Foundation](#2.1)

The goal is to get comfortable with programming and to understand the software abstraction model (via Python, C, and Assembly; high-level to low-level, with Python representing the highest-level of abstraction). You most likely don't need to be fluent in any Assembly language (they are mostly compilation targets), but to be able to read and find errors in assembly generated by smaller programs is probably a good idea.

#### <a name="2.1.1" class="anchor"></a> [Python](#2.1.1)

- Get proficient or fluent (very powerful programming language with a lot of support, look at some numerical libraries as well, especially NumPy)
- Try to implement an interpreter; see [Let’s Build A Simple Interpreter](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/)
- **Bonus:** Try to implement game of life; see [Programming Projects for Advanced Beginners #2: Game of Life](https://robertheaton.com/2018/07/20/project-2-game-of-life/).

#### <a name="2.1.2" class="anchor"></a> [C](#2.1.2)

- Learn basics of memory allocation and pointers; try to understand the assembly code generated for smaller programs (gcc -S option)
- Get familiar with C++ (could also get proficient or fluent if appropriate)

#### <a name="2.1.3" class="anchor"></a> [Assembly](#2.1.3)

- x86, ARM (could also explore other architectures if more appropriate); see [x86 Assembly Guide](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs216/guides/x86.html) and [ARM Hardware and Assembly Language](https://www.cs.uaf.edu/courses/cs301/2014-fall/notes/arm-asm/)
