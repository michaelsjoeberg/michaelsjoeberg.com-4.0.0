## <a name="1" class="anchor"></a> [Introduction](#1)

<!-- Genetic algorithms is a subclass of evolutionary computing and part of population-based search methods inspired by the theory of evolution. The theory of evolution states that an offspring has many characteristics of its parents, which implies population is stable, and variations in characterisitcs between individuals passed from one generation to the next often is due to inherited characteristics, where some percentage of offsprings survive to adulthood. Genetic algorithms borrow much of its terminology from biology, such as natural selection, evolution, gene, chromosome, mating, crossover, and mutation. Binary genetic algorithms (BGA) work well with continuous and discrete variables, can handle large number of decision variables, and optimize decision variables for cost functions. A BGA is less likely to get stuck in local minimum and often find global minimum. The common components of a BGA implementation are: variable encoding and decoding, fitness function (cost function), initial population, selection, mutation, offspring generation, and convergance condition. -->

Genetic algorithms are a type of computational method that uses concepts from biology, such as natural selection and evolution, to find solutions to problems. They are a subclass of evolutionary computing and are used to search through a large set of potential solutions to find the best one. One specific type of genetic algorithm, called a binary genetic algorithm (BGA), is effective at working with both continuous and discrete variables and optimizing many decision variables at once. It is also less likely to get stuck in local minima, meaning it can often find the overall best solution (global minimum). To use a BGA, we need to define certain components, including an encoding and decoding system for variables, a fitness function to evaluate potential solutions, an initial population of solutions, and rules for selection, mutation, and generating new solutions. The algorithm will continue to run until it meets a pre-defined convergence condition.

<!-- BGA need decision variables to be represented as binary chromosomes, where each gene is coded by `M_BITS`, and need to be decoded before evaluated by cost function `f`. A population, `N_POP`, is a group of chromosomes, each representing a potential solution to `f`. -->

The decision variables must be represented as binary chromosomes. Each gene in the chromosome is coded using a certain number of bits (denoted as `M_BITS`) and must be decoded before it can be evaluated by the cost function (denoted as `f`). A population (denoted as `N_POP`) is a group of chromosomes, with each chromosome representing a potential solution to the optimization problem defined by the cost function `f`. The BGA works by searching through the population of chromosomes, selecting the fittest ones, and generating new solutions through crossover and mutation.

#### <a name="2.1" class="anchor"></a> [Encoding](#2.1)

The function for encoding a decimal number into a binary representation is as follows.

```python
def encode(x, x_low, x_high, m):
    decimal = round((x - x_low) / ((x_high - x_low) / (2 ** m - 1)))
    binary = []
    while decimal >= 1:
        if decimal % 2 == 1:
            binary.append(1)
        else:
            binary.append(0)
        decimal = math.floor(decimal / 2)
    while len(binary) < 4:
        binary.append(0)

    return list(reversed(binary))
```

```python
assert encode(9, -10, 14, 5) == [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
```

The values `x_low` and `x_high` represent the lower and upper bounds of the range within which the decimal number `x` must be. The value `m` is the number of bits used to encode each gene in the binary representation (denoted as `M_BITS`).

#### <a name="2.2" class="anchor"></a> [Decoding](#2.2)

The function for decoding a binary representation into a decimal number is `x = x_low + B * ((x_high - x_low) / ((2 ** m) - 1))`, where `B` is binary value to convert into decimal.

```python
def decode(B, x_low, x_high, m):    
    return x_low + int((''.join(map(str, B))), 2) * ((x_high - x_low) / ((2 ** m) - 1))
```

```python
assert int(decode([1, 1, 0, 0, 1], -10, 14, 5)) == 9
assert round(decode([1, 0, 0, 0], 10, 20, 4), 2) == 15.33
```

#### <a name="2.3" class="anchor"></a> [Generate population](#2.3)

<!-- The initial population is generated at random, encoded and decoded for consistency, evaluated using the cost function, and then appended to cost table (sorted). The index in cost table is fixed and should not be associated with a specific chromosome, so needs to be updated after each iteration (assuming there are better solutions). -->

The initial population of solutions are typically generated randomly and then encoded into binary chromosomes. The chromosomes are decoded and evaluated using the cost function to determine how well they solve the optimization problem. The resulting values are then appended to a cost table, which is sorted in ascending order (smaller is better fit). It is important to note that the index in the cost table should not be tied to a specific chromosome, as the population may change over time. Therefore, the index should be updated after each iteration in the BGA process, as there may be new, better solutions that have been added to the population.

```python
def generate_population(n_pop, x_range, y_range, m_bits, seed=False):
    if seed != False:
        random.seed(seed)
    pop_lst = []
    for i in range(n_pop):
        x = random.randint(x_range[0], x_range[1])
        y = random.randint(y_range[0], y_range[1])
        # encoded values
        x_encoded = encode(x, x_range[0], x_range[1], m_bits)
        y_encoded = encode(y, y_range[0], y_range[1], m_bits)
        # decoded values
        x_decoded = round(decode(x_encoded, x_range[0], x_range[1], m_bits), 2)
        y_decoded = round(decode(y_encoded, y_range[0], y_range[1], m_bits), 2)
        # determine initial cost
        cost = round(f(x_decoded, y_decoded), 2)
        # append to list
        pop_lst.append([i, x_encoded + y_encoded, [x_decoded, y_decoded], cost])
    # sort on cost
    pop_lst.sort(key = lambda x: x[3])
    # update index
    for i in range(len(pop_lst)):
        pop_lst[i][0] = i

    return pop_lst
```

<!-- The `seed` parameter is used to set random seed to `42`, which should give same initial population as below (with same configuration variables). -->

The `seed` parameter is used to set the random seed for generating the initial population. By setting the seed to a specific value, such as 42, the algorithm will always generate the same initial population given the same configuration variables.

```python
example_population = generate_population(
    n_pop=6,
    x_range=[5, 20],
    y_range=[-5, 15],
    m_bits=4,
    seed=42)
```

This can be useful for testing purposes, as it allows us to easily reproduce the same results.

```python
print(tabulate(example_population, headers=['n', 'encoding', 'decoded x, y', 'cost'], floatfmt=".3f", tablefmt="simple"), end="\n\n")
#   n  encoding                  decoded x, y       cost
# ---  ------------------------  --------------  -------
#   0  [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  [7.0, 13.67]     22.160
#   1  [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1]  [8.0, 12.33]     30.680
#   2  [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  [8.0, -5.0]     100.000
#   3  [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]  [13.0, 1.67]    119.140
#   4  [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]  [12.0, -1.0]    126.000
#   5  [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]  [18.0, -3.67]   213.030
```

#### <a name="2.4" class="anchor"></a> [Generate offsprings (double-point crossover)](#2.4)

To generate offsprings using double-point crossover, we need to select two parent chromosomes from the population and choose two points within them as crossover points (at random or otherwise). We then split the chromosomes at these points to create four segments. The first and fourth segments are swapped between the two parent chromosomes to create two new offsprings.

```python
def generate_offsprings(population, crossover):
    n = 0
    offsprings_lst = []
    while n < len(population):
        offsprings_lst.append(population[n][1][0:crossover[0]] + population[n + 1][1][crossover[0]:crossover[1]] + population[n][1][crossover[1]:])
        offsprings_lst.append(population[n + 1][1][0:crossover[0]] + population[n][1][crossover[0]:crossover[1]] + population[n + 1][1][crossover[1]:])
        # pair-wise
        n += 2

    return offsprings_lst
```

This process combines characteristics from both parent chromosomes in the offsprings, allowing for greater diversity in the population.

### <a name="2.4" class="anchor"></a> [Mutation](#2.4)

```python
def mutate(offsprings, mu, m_bits):
    nbits = round(mu * (len(offsprings) * m_bits * 2))
    for i in range(nbits):
        offspring = random.randint(0, len(offsprings) - 1)
        bit = random.randint(0, m_bits * 2 - 1)
        # swap bits
        if offsprings[offspring][bit] == 1:
            offsprings[offspring][bit] = 0
        else:
            offsprings[offspring][bit] = 1

    return offsprings
```

### <a name="2.5" class="anchor"></a> [Update population](#2.5)

```python
def update_population(current_population, offsprings, keep, x_range, y_range, m_bits):
    offsprings_lst = []
    for i in range(len(offsprings)):
        # decoded values
        x_decoded = round(decode(offsprings[i][:4], x_range[0], x_range[1], m_bits), 2)
        y_decoded = round(decode(offsprings[i][4:], y_range[0], y_range[1], m_bits), 2)
        # determine initial cost
        cost = round(f(x_decoded, y_decoded), 2)
        # append to list
        offsprings_lst.append([i, offsprings[i], [x_decoded, y_decoded], cost])
    # sort on cost
    offsprings_lst.sort(key = lambda x: x[3])
    # update index
    for i in range(len(offsprings_lst)):
        offsprings_lst[i][0] = i
    # discard current population
    current_population[keep:] = offsprings_lst[:keep]
    # sort on cost
    current_population.sort(key = lambda x: x[3])
    # update index
    for i in range(len(current_population)):
        current_population[i][0] = i

    return current_population
```

## <a name="3" class="anchor"></a> [Running](#3)

Set configuration variables `M_BITS`, `N_POP`, `N_KEEP`, `MUTATE_RATE`, crossover locations, which could also be random, constraints, such as maxium number of iterations and range of decision variables, and define cost function.

```python
M_BITS = 4
N_POP = 4
N_KEEP = 2
MUTATE_RATE = 0.1

# generations
MAX_GEN = 10000

# cost function
def f(x, y):
    return -x * (y / 2 - 10)

# range
x_range = [10, 20]
y_range = [-5, 7]

# crossover
crossover = [3, 6]
```

Generate initial population.

```python
current_population = generate_population(N_POP, x_range, y_range, M_BITS)
print(tabulate(current_population, headers=['n', 'encoding', 'decoded x, y', 'cost'], floatfmt=".3f", tablefmt="github"), end="\n\n")
```

|   n | encoding                 | decoded x, y   |    cost |
|-----|--------------------------|----------------|---------|
|   0 | [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0] | [16.0, 4.6]    | 123.200 |
|   1 | [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0] | [12.67, -0.2]  | 127.970 |
|   2 | [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0] | [14.0, -3.4]   | 163.800 |
|   3 | [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0] | [16.0, -1.8]   | 174.400 |

Generate better population.

```python
for i in range(MAX_GEN):
    # generate offsprings
    offsprings = generate_offsprings(current_population, crossover)
    # mutate
    offsprings = mutate(offsprings, MUTATE_RATE, M_BITS)
    # update population
    current_population = update_population(current_population, offsprings, N_KEEP, x_range, y_range, M_BITS)

print(tabulate(current_population, headers=['n', 'encoding', 'decoded x, y', 'cost'], floatfmt=".3f", tablefmt="github"), end="\n\n")
```

|   n | encoding                 | decoded x, y   |   cost |
|-----|--------------------------|----------------|--------|
|   0 | [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1] | [10.0, 7.0]    | 65.000 |
|   1 | [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1] | [10.0, 7.0]    | 65.000 |
|   2 | [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1] | [10.0, 7.0]    | 65.000 |
|   3 | [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0] | [10.0, 6.2]    | 69.000 |
