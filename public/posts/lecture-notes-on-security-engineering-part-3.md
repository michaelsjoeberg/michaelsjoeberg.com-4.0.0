## <a name="1" class="anchor"></a> [Assembly basics](#1)

An assembly language is a low-level symbolic language with processor specific instructions and syntax, such as those developed at AT&T and Intel. Instructions, syntax, data types, registers, and hardware support are typically specified in the instruction set architecture (ISA), which represent an abstract model of some computer implementation.

An assembly program is a sequence of instructions, where each instruction represents an actual operation to be performed by the processor.

In most assembly-like languages, an instruction has the form `mnemonic <source>, <destination>` (AT&T syntax, or `mnemonic <destination>, <source>` in Intel syntax) such as `mov %eax, %ebx`, which is instruction to copy value from `%eax` to `%ebx`:

- mnemonics tell the CPU what to do, such as `mov`, `add`, `sub`, `push`, `pop`, `call`, and `jmp`
- source and destination
    - registers, such as `%eax`, `%esp`, or `%al`
    - memory location, such as `0x401000, 8(%ebp)` or `%edx, %ecx, 4`
    - constants (source only), such as `$42` or `$0x401000`

- directives are commands for assembler
    - `.data` to identify section with variables
    - `.text` to identify section with code
    - `.byte`, `.word`, or `.long` to define integer as 8, 16, or 32-bit
    - `.ascii` or `.asciz` to define string with or without terminator

- labels represent symbols at current address, so `number: .byte 42` is same as `char number = 42;` in the C programming language

### <a name="1.1" class="anchor"></a> [Registers](#1.1)

A register is a memory location on the CPU and prefixed with `%`. There are general-purpose registers, which includes stack pointer `%esp`, frame pointer `%ebp`, and instruction pointer `%eip`, and flags registers:

- extended (32-bit), such as `%eax`, `%ebx`, `%ecx`, `%edx`, `%esi`, and `%edi`
- smaller parts (16-bit), such as `%ax`, `%bx`, `%cx`, `%dx`, `%sp` (stack pointer), `%bp` (frame pointer), `%si`, and `%di`
- lower byte, such as `%a1`, `%b1`, `%c1`, and `%d1`
- second byte, such as `%ah`, `%bh`, `%ch`, and `%dh`

A constant is prefixed with `$` and operand size is specified as suffix to mnemonic, where byte is `b` (8 bit), word is `w` (16 bit), and long is `l` (32-bit or 64-bit floating point). 

Below is the initial layout and final layout after `mov $1, %eax`, or copy 1 and set rest to zero (note that `%ax` is bits 0-15 and `%eax` is bits 0-31):

|       |       |     |     |
| ----- | ----- | --- | --- |
| `%a1` | `%ah` |     |     |
| 0     | 8     | 16  | 31  |

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | ---  | ---  | ---  |
| `%a1` | `%ah` |
| 10000000 | 00000000 | 0 – 0 | 0 – 0 |
| 0 | 8 | 16 | 31 |

In programs, a memory location is accessed using pointers, which are variables that store memory addresses. Dereferencing a pointer means accessing the value stored at the memory address pointed to by the pointer.

In order to dereference a pointer, the memory address must be computed based on the contents of the base and index registers with an optional constant displacement and scaling factor (determined by architecture and instruction set).

## <a name="2" class="anchor"></a> [Assembly programming](#2)

Assembly programs are practically always generated by compilers and hand-writing programs using assembly instructions is not very efficient (and can be very error prone).

Below is an assembly program to output `hello assembly` (note that `r*` is 64 bit).

```x86asm
; assembly program (64-bit, intel syntax)
section .text
    global _main        ; start point for execution

_main:
    mov rax, 1          ; write (system call)
    mov rdi, 1          ; stdout
    mov rsi, msg        ; address to output
    mov rdx, 14         ; bytes to output
    syscall             ; invoke write
    mov rax, 60         ; exit (system call)
    xor rdi, rdi        ; 0
    syscall             ; invoke exit

section .data
    ; db is raw bytes and line feed \n is 0xah, or 10
    msg db "hello assembly", 10
```

It is often easier to explore assembly programs in emulators, such as [nasm Online Compiler](https://rextester.com/l/nasm_online_compiler) or [Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/).

### <a name="2.1" class="anchor"></a> [Data transfer](#2.1)

Data transfer instructions are used to move data between registers, memory, and stack.

```x86asm
; set destination as source
mov <source>, <destination>

; swap destinations
xchg <destination>, <destination>

; store source on top of stack
push <source>

; get destination from top of stack
pop <destination>
```

### <a name="2.2" class="anchor"></a> [Binary arithmetic](#2.2)

Binary arithmetic instriuctions are used to perform arithmetic operations on binary data.

```x86asm
; addition, destination += source
add <source>, <destination>

; subtraction, destination -= source
sub <source>, <destination>

; increment, destination += 1
inc <destination>

; decrement, destination -= 1
dec <destination>

; negation, destination = -destination
neg <destination>
```

### <a name="2.3" class="anchor"></a> [Logical operators](#2.3)

Logical operator instructions are used to perform logical operations on binary data.

```x86asm
; and, destination &= source
and <source>, <destination>

; or, destination |= source
or <source>, <destination>

; exclusive or, destination ^= source
xor <source>, <destination>

; not, destination = ~destination
not <destination>
```

### <a name="2.4" class="anchor"></a> [Unconditional branches](#2.4)

Unconditional branch instructions are used to change the flow of execution.

```x86asm
; jump to address
jmp <address>

; push return address and call function at address
call <address>

; pop return address and return
ret

; call OS-defined handler represented by const
int <const>
```

### <a name="2.5" class="anchor"></a> [Conditional branches](#2.5)

Conditional branch instructions are used to change the flow of execution based on the value of the flags register.

```x86asm
; jump below (unsigned), %eax < %ebx (label is location)
cmp %ebx, %eax
jb <label>

; jump not less (signed), %eax >= %ebx
cmp %ebx, %eax
jnl <label>

; jump zero, %eax = 0
test %eax, %eax
jz <label>

; jump not signed, or not below (signed), %eax >= 0
cmp $0, %eax
jns <label>
```

### <a name="2.6" class="anchor"></a> [Other instructions](#2.6)

Other common instructions, such as `lea` and `nop`.

```x86asm
; load effective address (source must be in memory), destination = &source
lea <source>, <destination>

; do nothing
nop
```
