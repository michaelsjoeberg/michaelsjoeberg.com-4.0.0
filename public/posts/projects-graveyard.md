*Here's a list of projects that I've worked on in the past but stopped due to lack of interest or some other reason. Most recent at top.*

## <a name="eqzen" class="anchor"></a> [EQZEN](#eqzen)

EQZEN was a project and business idea I started to work on in 2015 (during undergraduate-studies at The Open University). I also developed a small web application to manipulate XML files all in the browser as my undergraduate final project to aid further development of this project. It had some users, but no one seemed to stick around very long. A company in Australia contacted me about developing a tailored version only for them, which they would pay for when done, but did not feel right.

## <a name="givetrees" class="anchor"></a> [GiveTrees (Plant for Earth)](#givetrees)

GiveTrees was a project that me and a friend started on the side in 2014. The idea was to create a game-like mobile application where people could plant trees. The trees planted by each user were tracked and actually planted in real-life. We managed to plant some thousands of trees, but the project was shut down in 2020 due to lack of interest.

## <a name="puffy" class="anchor"></a> [Adventures of Puffy](#puffy)

Adventures of Puffy was my first successful attempt at creating a game. It was a flappy bird-type of game that just goes on forever. It was available on iOS for a while, but automatically removed from stores later due to inactivity.

*Note also the name used: FrozenFork. I still use this today as DBA for Terminal at [terminal.frozenfork.com](https://terminal.frozenfork.com)*

## <a name="clusterly" class="anchor"></a> [Clusterly](#clusterly)

Clusterly was a brief attempt at a social media platform inspired by the TV-series [Sense8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense8). The idea was to loosely match eight random chatters into a "cluster". The matching was supposed to be automatic and based on interests. I was invovled with developing a working demo but everyone mostly stopped working on this a few weeks later.

## <a name="tauland" class="anchor"></a> [Tauland](#tauland)

Tauland was my first attempt at creating a game. The idea was to make an educational quiz-like game with user-specific characters and progress. I was in contact with several schools in Sweden that said that they were interested in similar digital educational tools but it was never finished.

## <a name="formulas" class="anchor"></a> [formul.as (Formlr)](#formulas)

Formulas and Forml were both basically static websites with common formulas in mathematics and physics. The idea was to monetize via advertising.

## <a name="rakna" class="anchor"></a> [Räkna.nu](#rakna)

Räkna.nu was a question and answer site for homework. It was basically a clone of StackOverflow but for mathematics and other high school-related topics. It was available in Swedish.
