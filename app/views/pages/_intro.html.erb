<!-- intro -->
<div class="font-family-serif">
  <p>I build web applications (full-stack), financial models (DCF analysis), and recently started to build compilers and domain-specific programming languages. I am interested in computational intelligence (evolutionary computation, neural networks, reinforcement learning), finance, and science in general (in particular computer-related). I speak fluent Swedish and English, conversational Norwegian, and learning Spanish.</p>

  <p>I have completed postgraduate studies in computer science at <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/" target="_blank">King's College London</a> (2020), with a focus on optimization problems, learning-based algorithms, and compiler construction. I have completed undergraduate studies at The Open University (full-time distance learning; 2018), with a focus on software engineering and applied mathematics. I have completed standalone postgraduate studies in corporate finance and financial research at <a href="http://business-school.open.ac.uk/" target="_blank">The Open University Business School</a> (part-time distance learning; 2021). I have a list with completed coursework <a href="/about/courses" data-turbolinks="true">here</a>. I used to make electronic music which can be found on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/michaelsjoeberg/popular-tracks" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-soundcloud fa-fw"></i> SoundCloud</a>. I am almost done building a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/jx6hfhfff2fbyri/AADuBHMQv8m7Mv5KyyPuJMSUa?dl=0" target="_blank">small house</a> in Sweden.</p>

  <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Programming languages on this website:</span> Python, C/C++, Rust, Scala (soon also Ruby and Go).</p>
